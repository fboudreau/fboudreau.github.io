Linux is a great operating system for embedded devices. It's an appropriate
choice for more devices as size and efficiency become better and better.

This site is about learning embedded linux by building a distro from scratch
and also by using build tools like [Buildroot](https://www.buildroot.org/),
[Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) and [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/).
