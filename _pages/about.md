This site is about learning embedded [Linux](https://kernel.org) by building a
distro from scratch and also by using build tools like
[Buildroot](https://www.buildroot.org/), [Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/)
and [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/).

Linux is a popular operating system for embedded devices. The use of Linux has
become a viable option to replace traditional Real-time Operating Systems
(RTOS) because of the lower cost and energy efficiency of hardware components
like Systems-on-Chip (SOC), DDR, Wi-Fi, and LTE.

Linux is preferred by developers because of the rich set of tools and libraries
available as open source. It reduces the dependency on vendors for feature
requests, bug fixes, and release cycles that often take months.

Component vendors prefer Linux because they can focus on supporting only
device drivers and for only one operating system.
