Embedded devices are everywhere. Most have software running and their increasing
complexity and connectivity has brought about the need for more fully featured
operating system.

Linux has become a popular choice among embedded device developers. It's ease
of use and plethora of available tools and libraries means that developers can
focus on application development and less on platform related code. 

Most component vendors  no longer providing RTOSes or their own embedded Linux
distos and instead only support Linux kernel drivers. Developers are forced to
adopt Linux as their embedded OS.
