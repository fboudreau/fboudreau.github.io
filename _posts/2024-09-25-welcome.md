Popular Linux distributions are typically too large for embedded devices.
Distros like Redhat, Ubuntu, CentOS, etc. are built for the desktop (and
servers) and include many applications, services and libraries that are
normally not needed for embedded devices. Things like a desktop environment,
email clients, and web browsers take up alot of storage space and are not
needed for most embedded applications.

The embedded device that you work with has particular requirements and
features. Your applications need only the operating system (OS)[^1] support to
implement those features, and nothing else. The less software you write, the
smaller the storage, RAM and CPU performance that will be needed, which lowers
cost of your product. This is particularly important for consumer devices that
have embedded devices.

In the past, embedded devices had very limited resources. CPUs were slow, RAM
was limited, less energy efficient and very costly. These limitations made
real-time constraints more difficult to achieve. The OS had to be very small
and efficient and Real-time operating systems[^2] (RTOS) were very popular.

However, RTOSes had few facilities to help developers write applications and to
debug them. Tools such as shells, shell commands, networking libraries and
device drivers either had to be written by the developers or had to be
purchased or licensed from the OS or component vendors. It was costly in both
effort and money.

Today, component prices and efficiency has arrived to the point where an
operating system kernel like Linux is viable. That said, cost always being an
issue, keeping the size of the storage device to a minimum is needed.

- Vendors use to support many RTOSes. 
- Vendors use to create and support their own RTOSes.
- Vendors use to create and support their own embedded Linux distros
- Component vendors only need to support device drivers
- SOC vendors only need to support BSP (1st, 2nd level bootloader, device
  drivers)
  
Linux has:

- Low cost of ownership
- Large number of libraries and other open source code
    - In the beginning, FOSS was buggy and costly to maintain. Not
      necessarily lower cost of ownership. Now different. Most important
      FOSS is mature
- Shell. Embedded device can be used by the developers like a desktop PC to
  code, debug, script, log, etc. Not need to develop of by IP stack, for
  example, like you had to do for VxWorks, FreeRTOS. No need to use NAND
  without a file-system... Etc.

- What's the difference?
- How popular is EL? Show data.
- Building blocks:
    - Bootloaders:
        - first level bootloader
        - second level bootloader
    - kernel to memory
    - kernel initialization sequence
    - user space

Notes:

One sentence premise: Embedded Linux is now viable. Popular distros are not
suitable.

In the past not viable because...

Now, OK and preferred.
